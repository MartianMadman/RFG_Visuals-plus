Visuals-plus is a mod for Red Faction Guerrilla that is able to provide a noticeable improvement in visual quality without any performance impact. It works by reducing ambient light brightness and removing fog nearclipping.

\Install from github/
This mod is made to work with RFG Mod Manager and doesn't need to be packed by the developer to work. To install from github you'll first obviously need to download the repository files. Then download the Mod Manager for RFG which can be found at (https://www.factionfiles.com/ff.php?action=search&pageaction=searchfiles&search_query=mod+manager&file_searchby=7&file_searchgame=3&file_searchcat=&file_sort=5) Use the readme in the Mod Manager download to read up on how to use it. Only the Mod Manager for the original RFG has the readme which is a bit inconvenient. Once done with that, go to the source directory of RFG_Visuals-plus and depending on which version of RFG you use, copy either the Classic or Remaster directory into the mods folder of Mod Manager. Optionally you should rename the directory you copied to Visuals-plus after you've put it in the mods folder. At this point you should be good to go and Mod Manager should be able to install it from here.
